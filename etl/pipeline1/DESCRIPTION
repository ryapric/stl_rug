Title: Example data pipeline in R
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Ryan", "Price", email = "ryapric@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description:
    This package serves as an example of how to design data pipelines
    in R. The process employed need not simply be transformations on the
    incoming data; you can do *whatever* you want, and load the results
    *anywhere* (ex. write to a database, save a model output as a `.rds` and
    upload to S3, etc.). This bare-bones example just demonstrates a read-write
    DB example showing how to automate pipelines in R.
